While medical imaging technology produces a vast amount of information, only a fraction is currently used to inform clinical decisions. We bridge this gap by developing advanced algorithms and strategies that make this wealth of data accessible and actionable for clinicians.

Our focus lies on creating tools for:

- (Un)supervised lesion detection and segmentation
- Accurate classification of medical images
- Multimodal data integration

In collaboration with our clinical partners at the TUM School of Medicine and Health, we prioritize research on two key neurological diseases: Multiple Sclerosis and Gliomas.

Committed to open science, we strive to make all our developed tools publicly available on this website. We further contribute to the advancement of the field by actively participating in leading challenges like [BraTS](https://synapse.org/brats2023) and workshops like [BrainLes](http://www.brainlesion-workshop.org/).
