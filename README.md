**AI for Image-Guided Diagnosis and Therapy**

**Prof. Dr. Benedikt Wiestler**

While medical imaging technology produces a vast amount of information, only a fraction is currently used to inform clinical decisions. We bridge this gap by developing advanced algorithms and strategies that make this wealth of data accessible and actionable for clinicians.

To achieve this goal, we are focusing on these main research areas: 

- Learning efficient, (self)supervised representations (and embeddings) for medical (imaging) data
- Developing predictive, in part biophysically informed, models for disease assessment and individualized therapy
- Designing algorithms and models that leverage the rich, synergistic information from multimodal medical data

Collaborating with our clinical partners at the TUM School of Medicine and Health, we prioritize research on two key neurological diseases: Multiple Sclerosis and Gliomas.

Committed to open science, we strive to make all of our developed tools available publicly. We further contribute to the advancement of the field by actively participating in leading challenges like [BraTS](https://synapse.org/brats2023) and workshops like [BrainLes](http://www.brainlesion-workshop.org/).
